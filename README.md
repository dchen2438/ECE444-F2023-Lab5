## What are the pros and cons of TDD?
TDD forces the developers to automate their testing process and plan ahead. This requires the developers to be on the same page and produce better code quality since the code written will need to be more modular and maintainable. It will also reduce the amount of testing needed and the number of bugs that need to be fixed at the time of deployment.
The cons of TDD includes longer development times, and over reliance on the tests leading to a false sense of security. Tests can also be difficult to maintain. This leads to extra time needed during the development cycle.
